# UFOs


## Overview
In this project, support was given to a person who wanted to develop an internet page where information about alien sightings in the world could be given, he wanted the page to be friendly so that people could review and filter the information that they most liked important to them

## Resources
Sofware : HTML, CSS, Javascript


## Results
The page itself was developed in HTML and CCS, where the corresponding design could be given, the information from where the data was taken and the code that could make its export feasible was in Javascript.As you can see a fairly simple but functional page, it has a heading, a short description of what the page is about and a table with the information that might most interest people, on the left side is where the filters are located. Users can add what information they are interested in, such as date, city, state, country and shape.

The following images are just a small test of how the page works

## Summary
The main problem that the page has is that the user really has to know what he is looking for or else he would only be wandering within the page until he really finds what he wants, there are quite a few options within the page such as In shapes, cities, countries, in it does not even tell you what date it is possible to perform the search, the people who use this page could become desperate if they do not know what they are looking for.

Some improvements that I would like to make to the page would be to be able to enter the options with which the filters can be made, or for example if I have the cursor inside a filter or if I am positioning myself there, I would like the page to display the options that I have to carry out the search since I could be missing valuable information or something that could interest me but I am missing it because I do not know what the database that I have in front of me contains.

And just another small recommendation would be that if I could already locate the information that interests me, the most logical thing would be that the page allows me to export the information to an excel, since it is the most convenient way in which users could save the information that most like it
